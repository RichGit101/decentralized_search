    "## The Problem with Centralized Search Engines\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://yacy.net/images/philosophie_gatekeeper.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a world where one company controls 77% of all searches, influencing trillions of dollars in spending, shaping perceptions and effectively acting as the primary gatekeeper to the Internet, a new, open and community-driven search engine is a necessity.\n",
    "- The 550 Billion dollar Advertising market is broken.\n",
    "- Online advertising sucks! Businesses are forced to pay huge amounts of money to “middlemen” like Google and Facebook in order to reach a captive audience for their promotions. \n",
    "- Ads often get placed among many other ads clogging up the space on crowded banners\n",
    "- Businesses also have little to no guarantee that the traffic they generate on their promotions is genuine. \n",
    "- 50% of all advertising traffic is generated by bots\n",
    "- Sellers pay for “impressions, views, and clicks” resulting in extremely low conversion rates, with only a loose correlation to return on investment\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Businesses end up losing money, and consumers end up paying more for less value, creating a lose-lose situation.\n",
    "- What if there was a system with no middlemen? \n",
    "- Instead, companies could make personalized offers directly to consumers based on their explicit search for goods and services\n",
    "-  Large online ad companies are also facing regulatory pressure to protect consumer privacy. \n",
    "- Recent changes to the ePrivacy Directive and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union  highlight the emerging trend of governments forcing technology companies to build-in consumer privacy by design.\n",
    "- Right now consumers have no choice but to give away their data for free in return for a free service\n",
    "- What if consumers were compensated for sharing their data?\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://steemitimages.com/0x0/http://i.imgur.com/7Q5XOvd.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ideally there would be a decentralized service that enables users to control their own privacy preferences, unlike “free” services like Google and Facebook, who often sell user data to brokers.\n",
    "- With decentralized search, previously wasted ad dollars are redirected to promotions that reach customers who are genuinely interested in the products being sold and rewards programs that are truly suitable for customer desires. \n",
    "- With a well-devised blockchain system, customer profiles can be elevated from shadowy privacy-invasive metadata, owned and controlled by third parties, into search metadata owned by customers and selectively revealed only when relevant to the search, creating a privacy-friendly marketplace where customers and businesses share in value creation. \n",
    "- By storing customer data in a protected way on the public blockchain (i.e., providing anonymity and selective data sharing), new forms of rewards and loyalty programs can emerge.\n",

    "## Examples of Decentralize Search Engines\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Presearch\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/A97ypn4.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Presearch is a decentralized search engine, powered by the community.\n",
    "- Trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTgnPd-eTuE\n",
    "- They want to build a community based concept of open, transparent and decentralized search results, where all stakeholders can help to confirm that platform is fair, to provide expected results, and create an ecosystem in which anyone can participate and incorporate Presearch into their workflows and business models\n",
    "- They leverage their PST token (ERC20 Ethereum based token) to reward and incentivize the community to use, promote and contribute to the platform, enabling Members to benefit by using the system and to be rewarded for engaging with Sponsors, rather than being a product that is monetized by the search engine.\n",
    "- An auction-based system will enable Sponsors to bid on placement using PSTs.\n",
    "- Members will earn rewards for allowing themselves to be introduced to Suggested Sponsors and Engines.\n",
    "- Like Wikipedia with Human curation as an important strategy combined with scalable machine learning approaches.\n",
    "- Their white paper is unimpressive, half of it is explaining why google is bad, and the other is them talking about future decision making for their platform. \n",
    "- Very little tech discussion, no open source code on github.\n",

    "## YaCy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://yacy.net/images/comparison_why_is_YaCy_better_en.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Search engine software. \n",
    "- Does not use a central server. \n",
    "- Instead, its search results come from a network of independent peers. \n",
    "- In such a distributed network, no single entity decides what gets listed, or in which order results appear.\n",
    "-  The YaCy search engine runs on each user's own computer. \n",
    "- Search terms are hashed before they leave the user's computer. \n",
    "- Different from conventional search engines, YaCy is designed to protect the users' privacy. \n",
    "- A user's computer can create with YaCy its individual search indexes and rankings, so that results better match what the user is looking for over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://yacy.net/material/YaCy-MainComponents.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- YaCy also makes it easy to create a customized search portal with a few clicks.\n",
    "- Each YaCy user is either part of a large search network (YaCy contains a peer-to-peer network protocol to exchange search indexes with other YaCy search engine installations) \n",
    "- or the user runs YaCy to produce a personal search portal that can be either public or private.\n",
    "- YaCy harvests web pages with a web crawler. Documents are then parsed, indexed and the search index is stored locally. \n",
    "- If your peer is part a peer network, then your local search index is also merged into the shared index for that network. \n",
    "- If a search is started then the local index contributes together with a global search index from peers in the YaCy search network.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://yacy.net/material/YaCy-DHT.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- YaCy peers continuously exchange index fragments using a Distributed Hash Table. Index data can therefore reach the local peer even before a user query is submitted, but of course it is still loaded from the remote peer network too when needed. \n",
    "- To store the search index, a special NoSQL data structure is used. This data structure is optimized for fast index delete and index merge to support the DHT functionality. The database also stores all other work data like document metadata and the document cache. No other SQL database is used.\n",
    "- To provide the search interface, the API and the administration interface a HTTP server is integrated.\n",
    "- A variety of external parser libraries allows you to read and process doc, xls, ppt, rtf, rss, html, xml, vcf, zip, gzip, tar, 7z, csv, torrent, odt, pdf, ps, swf and other formats. \n",
    "- YaCy reads documents using the following protocols: http, https, ftp, smb and from the file system of the local host.\n",

    "## What is BitClave? \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://dn63irfe7i6a.cloudfront.net/3d13a3390cefa13337c3262905685ac5b6fda028/img/og/og.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- BitClave uses blockchain to eliminate ad service middleman. \n",
    "- The company’s objective is to create a direct connection between businesses and customers. \n",
    "- BitClave is building a decentralized search engine that helps users search for items without losing control of their own personal information. \n",
    "- Users also get compensated every time they click on search results for products and services from their favorite brands. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://steemitimages.com/0x0/http://s3.amazonaws.com/main-newsbtc-images/2017/09/19010656/Webp.net-resizeimage-2.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",

    "- The process makes third-party advertising networks unnecessary. For more information, please visit a website.\n",
    "- Completed its token sale hitting the hard cap of 25.5 million within 32 seconds. \n",
    "- More than 13 000 transactions were made. \n",
    "- It’s a tremendous result, that highlights the level of interest and confidence in the concept and suggests a bright future for the project.\n",
    "- It’s a shift away from the traditional method of simply gathering huge pools of user data from social media sites and search engines and using this to influence more general ads – an arrangement that’s been annoying for users and inefficient for advertisers.\n",
    "- BitClave aims to create an open search marketplace to keep advertising prices transparent and fair. The system BitClave proposes would cut out third-party intermediaries such as Google AdWords that keep consumers and marketers separated.\n",
    "-  Trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQlQv4zi6YI\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://i1.wp.com/cryptorated.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bitclaive-4.png?resize=578%2C379&ssl=1 \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a BitClave search world, businesses would be able to reach their target audience with an extremely high degree of specificity.\n",
    "- This hyper-focused targeting would allow businesses to get more bang for their advertising buck, as well as start showing consumers highly relevant ads. \n",
    "- For example, if you’re a yoga studio, you’d essentially be able to find anyone who does yoga and send them your advertisements.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://lvena26b6e621o8sl2qkx1ql-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-03-at-4.41.11-PM.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- While this functionality can be somewhat carried out using traditional PPC (pay-per-click) methods, it still leads to a lot of waste. \n",
    "- Businesses end up shooting a blunderbuss load of ads at a general audience and hope for the best. The BitClave system would be much more accurate.\n",
    "- The BitClave system would use a form of incentivized search, where people would only see ads if they have a stated interest in seeing them. \n",
    "- This way, not only are a business’s target audiences easier to reach, they’re also warmed up and that much closer to making a purchase.\n",
    "- For example, let’s say you’re searching for a new house. You’d begin your search on the BitClave platform, and then start seeing advertisements from realtors who match your criteria. Not only would you have curated and specific advertisements, you would also earn CAT, the BitClave token, when you engage with those ads.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Registration subsystem is responsible for verifying customer/business information wherever possible.\n",
    "- Registration Service will be identified by its public key, so every interested participant will be able to verify the authenticity of the information signed by the Registration Service,\n",
    "- Request Subssytem filters out spam and untrusting businesses . that does not satisfy customer REQUEST. This could happen by mistake or\n",
    "- Request also collects relevant personal information as part of REQUEST process. For example, while looking for car insurance, the system might ask for a more detailed questions like current house insurance, previous car insurance or life insurance. \n",
    "- It also recommends to a customer what private information to reveal to get a better OFFER. \n",
    "- Usually, OFFER will include different reward based on customer personal information \n",
    "- Business can submit OFFERS to BASE, define OFFER structure based on individual customer information, run data analytics to understand what OFFERs are working and other related activities.\n",
    "-  The Search Service is an independent entity that is matching REQUESTs with OFFERs. \n",
    "- Search Service incentive is to maximize the number of transactions in BASE. Search Service could be optionally incentivized by CATs\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/IBFAbu1.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transaction speed on Ethereum is on the order of tens per second \n",
    "-  All communication is between REQUEST and OFFER, and the rest of the blockchain does not care about the details of this negotiation. \n",
    "- What is important is whether the transaction happened or not, so we can use a direct “state channel” and write only the final result to the blockchain. \n",
    "- Furthermore, in case an OFFER is from a business that a customer is making continual purchases, the state can be stored off-chain for a longer period of time, until one of the parties decides to post the state to blockchain for global visibility. \n",
    "- In this scenario, even more transactions are offloaded from the main blockchain.\n",
